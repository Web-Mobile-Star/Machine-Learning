# Ml Service

This repo contains the machine-learning service to host our model.
The `master` is the emptiest branch, containing the bare skeleton of the service and the logging to the postgres DB.
* Your first task is to implement the `_load_model()` dependency. The solution to this can be found on the branch `solution_load_model`
* Then we will send some requests using the cli package provided.
* Lastly we will optimize the loading process. The solution to this can be found on the branch `solution_optimization`
